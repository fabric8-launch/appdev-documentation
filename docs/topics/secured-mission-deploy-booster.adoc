== Deploy Booster to your {OpenShiftLocal}
Once you have your {OpenShiftLocal} running, check the console output for the URL you can use to access it.

The {runtime-name} Booster needs to be packaged and deployed. This process will generate the uber jar file, the OpenShift resources and deploy them within the current project of the your {OpenShiftLocal} server. Make sure you pass in the SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL you obtained during the <<SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL>> step.
