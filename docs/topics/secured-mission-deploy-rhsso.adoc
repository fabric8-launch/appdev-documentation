[[mission-secured-deploy-rhsso]]
= Deploy RH SSO to your {OpenShiftLocal}

== Deploy the SSO server.

From the `sso` directory of this Booster project, simply run the following command:
[source,shell]
----
$ mvn fabric8:deploy

[[SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL]]
== Determine the SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL Value
For the Secured REST booster, you need to configure the {RHSSO} authorization endpoint. The booster project generates 
`target/sso-client.jar` when you built the {RHSSO} server. You can run `target/sso-client.jar` from the command line to determine the `SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL`.

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ java -jar target/sso-client.jar --displaySSOURL
Successful oc get routes: Yes
Using auth server URL: https://secure-sso-sso.e8ca.engint.openshiftapps.com/auth
Available application endpoint names: [secured-vertx-rest, secured-swarm-rest, secured-springboot-rest]
----

The line starting with `Using auth server URL:` is the line that provides the `SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL`. In this case it is `https://secure-sso-sso.e8ca.engint.openshiftapps.com/auth`. You will need this value later.
