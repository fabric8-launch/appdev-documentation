Hello,

We have released the Fabric8 Launcher documentation today:

Docs link: https://launcher.fabric8.io/docs/

We have also synced the documentation to the Customer Portal stage:

To access the docs stage:
1) Log in to Customer Portal
2) Open https://access.redhat.com/documentation/red-hat-openshift-application-runtimes/?lb_target=stage
3) Refresh the page if you do not see a red box saying "This is the stage version of this page."

Tag: $LINK_TO_THE_TAG
Diff: $LINK_TO_THE_COMPARISON

We would like to ask the QE team to verify the content in stage is correct.

The following issues were fixed:

https://issues.jboss.org/projects/RHOARDOC/versions/$RELEASE_ID

Please reach out to rhoar-docs-team@redhat.com if you have any questions.
