= Using an Automated Script

You can install the Launchpad to {OpenShiftLocal} using link:{link-launchpad-install-script}[an automated script]. The script will:

* Create a project in {OpenShiftLocal}.
* Deploy the Launchpad to that project using the link:{link-launchpad-yaml}[latest template].
* Configure the Launchpad with your GitHub username and personal access token.
* Update the Jenkins _serviceaccount_ to use the `admin` role.

To use the automated script: 

. link:{link-launchpad-install-script}[Download] the script.
. Run the script.
** Run the script with username and password.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./deploy_launchpad_mission.sh -p LAUNCHPAD_PROJECT_NAME -i developer:developer -g GITHUB_USERNAME:GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
----

** Run the script with {OpenShiftLocal} access token.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./deploy_launchpad_mission.sh -p LAUNCHPAD_PROJECT_NAME -i OPENSHIFT_TOKEN -g GITHUB_USERNAME:GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
----

** Run the script and specify the version of the Launchpad template to use.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./deploy_launchpad_mission.sh -p LAUNCHPAD_PROJECT_NAME -i developer:developer -g myGithubUser:myGithubToken -v v3
----

. Once the script completes, return to the {OpenShiftLocal} web console and click on your Launchpad project.

This is your project's overview page and you can see its current status.

The grey circles reference that the docker images for these services are being pulled down from the network. This is a one time step that may take some time. Eventually the circles will turn a light blue to note that they are starting, then a deeper blue to indicate when they are running. 
+
When all services are running, you are ready to use the Launchpad application.  

. Click the link at the top of all services, which should end in `nip.io`.
+
A new browser tab will open with the Launchpad.

You are now running on your local cloud the same service we will be hosting over at `launch.openshift.io`. See the link:{link-getting-started-guide}#boosters[{getting-started-guide-name}] for more details on using the Launchpad to launch mission booster applications.
