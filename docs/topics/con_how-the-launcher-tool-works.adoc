= How {name-launcher} works

{name-launcher} runs on OpenShift and lets you create functional example applications.
The {name-launcher} tool walks you through:

* choosing the mission you want to generate,
* choosing the runtime you want to use,
* choosing the capabilities your application will have, and
* choosing how you want to build and execute the mission.

{name-launcher} uses your choices to generate a custom project, and:

* launches it directly to the same OpenShift instance, or
* provides a downloadable ZIP version of the project for you to modify and deploy yourself.
