NOTE: We are working on removing this step entirely, but for now it is required. The full details and a current status are available link:https://github.com/openshiftio/launchpad-templates/issues/2[on GitHub].

. Fill out the following fields.
** _Your GitHub username_.
** _Your GitHub Mission Control access token_ is your personal access token for GitHub.
** The _Target OpenShift Console URL_ is the OpenShift Console URL from your {OpenShiftLocal}. This should be the same base URL you are currently using to complete the form, for example `https://192.168.42.152:8443`.
** OpenShift username and password from your {OpenShiftLocal}, for example `developer` for the username and password.
** _KeyCloak URL_ and _KeyCloak Realm_ should be cleared out
+
WARNING: You must clear these fields out for the {launcher} application on your {OpenShiftLocal} to be configured correctly.

** _Catalog Git Repository_ and _Catalog Git Reference_ should be generally left as-is, unless you are developing against a specific fork you would like to use.
** _{launcher} Frontend Host_ must be updated to replace `$PROJECTNAME` with the name of your project. You also need to update `$HOSTNAMEORIP` in the string to the IP address of your OpenShift Console URL. This example uses `+++192.168.42.152+++` and `{launcher}`.
+
WARNING: Before proceeding to the next steps, confirm all the fields are correct.

. Click `Create` to complete the setup. You will see a screen confirming that the application has been created. Click _Continue to overview_.

. On the overview page, wait and confirm that the three services for the {launcher} application are starting up.
+

+
The grey circles reference that the docker images for these services are being pulled down from the network. This is a one time step that may take some time. Eventually the circles will turn a light blue to note that they are starting, then a deeper blue to indicate when they are running.

. When all services are running, you are ready to use the {launcher} application.  Click the link at the top of all services, which should end in `nip.io`, and a new browser tab will open with the {launcher} application.

You are now running on your local cloud the same service we will be hosting over at `launch.openshift.io`.
