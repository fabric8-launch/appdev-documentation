= Introduction to The {launcher} Application

This chapter provides a brief overview of what the {launcher} application is.

.The {launcher} Application
The {launcher} application runs on OpenShift and provides a hassle-free way of creating functional example applications called missions. Using the {launcher} application walks you through:

* Choosing the mission you want to generate
* Choosing the runtime you want to use
* Choosing how you want to build and execute the mission

The {launcher} application uses your choices to generate a custom project, called a booster, and either launches it directly to the same OpenShift instance, or provides a downloadable ZIP version of the project.
