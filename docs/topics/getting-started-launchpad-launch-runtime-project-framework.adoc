* Create a new GitHub repository associated with your account containing the runtime project framework's code.
* Deploy a continuous deployment pod to {OpenShiftLocal} to deploy your runtime project framework's code.
* The continuous deployment pod will then build and deploy your runtime project framework's code to {OpenShiftLocal}.
