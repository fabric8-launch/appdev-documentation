Developing cloud native applications and services is different than developing on-premise, monolithic applications. When learning how to create cloud native applications and services, developers need a local environment that matches the target cloud environment. The {launcher} application provides a painless way for developers to create functional, example applications called missions and easily build and deploy them to a cloud environment. The missions are working applications that showcase different fundamental pieces of building cloud native applications and services, such as creating HTTP APIs, interoperating with a database, or implementing the health check pattern. Each mission is comprised of different boosters that show how to implement the same mission in different runtimes and can be updated or extended for your own use case. Using {launcher} with the missions keeps you focused on learning to develop applications and services for the target cloud environment from the beginning.
