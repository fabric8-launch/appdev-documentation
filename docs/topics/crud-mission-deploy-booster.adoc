=== Deploy Using the `oc` CLI Client

. Get your authentication token for using the `oc` CLI client with {OpenShiftLocal}. You can find this in the {OpenShiftLocal} Web console. In the above example, your token would be located at `https://192.168.99.100:8443/console/command-line`.

. Authenticate your `oc` CLI client with your {OpenShiftLocal} account by using your authentication token.

. Use maven to start the deployment to {OpenShiftLocal}.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----
+
This command uses the Fabric8 Maven Plugin to launch the S2I process on {OpenShiftLocal} and to start the pod.

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get pods -w
NAME                             READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

.Example Route Information
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get routes
NAME                 HOST/PORT                                     PATH      SERVICES             PORT      TERMINATION
{app-name}   {app-name}-{project-name}.192.168.99.100.nip.io      {app-name}   8080
----
+
A pod's route information gives you the base URL which you use to access it. In the example above, you would use `http://{app-name}-{project-name}.192.168.99.100.nip.io` as the base URL to access the application.
