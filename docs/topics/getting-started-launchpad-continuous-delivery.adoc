To launch using continuous delivery, click the _Use OpenShift Online to build and deploy_ button. This will:

* Create, in your GitHub namespace, a repository containing your new project's code
* Create a pipeline to continuously deliver the code on each push to your repositoryâ€™s master branch
* Execute the pipeline, which will build and deploy the codebase on OpenShift Online.  This may take a few minutes.
