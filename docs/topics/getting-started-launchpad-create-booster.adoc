= Use the Launchpad to launch a Booster

After you have the Launchpad running on {OpenShiftLocal}, you can use it to create a new project, your Booster.

To create a Booster:

. Navigate to the Launchpad using your browser.
. Select _Prepare for Takeoff_.
. Choose the mission and runtime you would like to run, for example `Health Check` and `{VertX}`.
+
NOTE: Each mission illustrates a concept and is implemented as a Booster in at least one runtime. You can come back to the Launchpad later and try another booster.

. You may update any of the pre-filled details or leave them with the default details. Click _Finish_.

Your Booster is now prepared for launch; follow the steps in xref:launchpad-launch-booster[] for takeoff.
