= Starting Preview Server

You can preview the documentation site locally. To do that, perform the following steps:

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* Docker installed.
* Docker daemon running.

== Procedure

.Running Preview Server Locally
. As root, run the `$REPO_HOME/cico_build_deploy.sh` script from the repository's base directory while setting the `CICO_LOCAL` environment variable to `true`:
+
--
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ sudo CICO_LOCAL=true ./cico_build_deploy.sh
----

NOTE: You must use `sudo` to run this script because it operates Docker. Being a member of the `docker` group instead is not a good security practice--see the Related Information section for more information.

This process may take a few minutes.
--
. Run the Docker container with the server:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ sudo docker run -p 80:8080 -it appdev-documentation-deploy:latest
----
. Navigate to `http://localhost` in your browser.
. When you are done, stop the Docker container with the server:
.. Go back to the terminal where the container is running.
.. Press `Ctrl + C`.
