This is an introduction to the mechanics of interacting with a remote service using the HTTP protocol. Specifically, this booster is an application that allows a user to:

* Execute an HTTP `GET` request on the `api/greeting` endpoint.
* Receive a response in JSON format with a payload consisting of the `Hello, World!` String.
* Execute an HTTP `GET` request on the `api/greeting` endpoint while passing in a String argument. This uses the `name` request parameter in the query string.
* Receive a response in JSON format with a payload of `Hello, $name!` with `$name` replaced by the value of the `name` parameter passed into the request.
