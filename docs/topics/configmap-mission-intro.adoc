This mission shows you how to:

* Set up and configure a `ConfigMap`.
* Use the configuration provided by the `ConfigMap` within an application.
* Deploy changes to the `ConfigMap` configuration of running applications.

.About Externalized Configuration
It is important for the application configuration to be externalized and separated from its code. This allows the application configuration to change as it moves through different environments while leaving the code unchanged. This also keeps sensitive or internal information out of your code base and version control. Many languages and application servers provide environment variables to support externalizing an application's configuration.
Microservices architectures and polyglot environments add a layer of complexity to managing an applications configuration. Applications are comprised of independent services and the configuration is distributed.
This creates a challenge of keeping the configuration synchronized and accessible from all services.

.About ConfigMap
_ConfigMap_ is an object used by OpenShift to inject configuration data as simple key and value pairs into one or more Linux containers while keeping the containers agnostic of OpenShift. You can create a ConfigMap object in a variety of different ways, including using a YAML file, and inject it into the Linux container. You can find more information about ConfigMap in the link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/configmaps.html[OpenShift documentation].


.Why ConfigMap is Important
ConfigMaps enable the application configuration to be externalized and used in individual Linux containers and pods in a language-agnostic way. ConfigMaps also allow sets of configuration data to be easily grouped and scaled, which enables you to configure an arbitrarily large number of environments beyond the basic _Development_, _Stage_, and _Production_.
