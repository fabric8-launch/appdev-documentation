----

. Perform any updates you want to the the project.

. Log in with your `oc` CLI client and change to your booster's project.

. Use Maven to start the deployment to OpenShift.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests
----
//+
//NOTE: A mission's booster may contain tests that assume the build process is running on OpenShift. Since you are building your mission's booster outside of OpenShift before deploying it, you can use `-DskipTests` to skip the testing process.
