= Missions

Missions are working applications that showcase different fundamental pieces of building cloud native applications and services, such as:

 * Creating REST APIs
 * Interoperating with a database
 * Implementing the Health Check pattern

Missions can be used as:

* A proof of technology demonstration.
* A teaching tool, or even a sandbox for understanding how to develop applications for your project.
* They can also be updated or extended for your own use case.

A booster is the implementation of a mission in a specific runtime. Boosters are preconfigured, functioning applications based on a mission that demonstrate a fundamental aspect of modern application development running in an environment similar to production.

NOTE: Each mission has different boosters that show how to implement the same mission in different runtimes. For example, the {name-mission-http-api} mission has a link:{link-mission-http-api-nodejs}[{NodeJS} booster], a link:{link-mission-http-api-spring-boot-tomcat}[{SpringBoot} booster], a link:{link-mission-http-api-vertx}[{VertX} booster], and a link:{link-mission-http-api-wf-swarm}[{WildFlySwarm} booster].
