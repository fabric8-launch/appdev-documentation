= Show Debug Logging on OpenShift

Use the the `DEBUG` environment variable in your application pod in OpenShift to enable debug logging.

.Prerequisites 
* An application with debug logging.
* The `oc` CLI client installed.


.Procedure

. Use the `oc` CLI client to log into your OpenShift instance.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login ...
----

. Deploy your application to OpenShift.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ npm run openshift
----
+
This runs the `openshift` npm script, which wraps direct calls to xref:about-nodeshift[nodeshift].

. Find the name of your pod and follow the logs to watch it start.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get pods
....
$ oc logs -f pod/POD_NAME
----
+
IMPORTANT: After your pod has started, keep watching the logs.

. Test your application. 
+
For example, if you had debug logging in the xref:mission-http-api-nodejs[{name-mission-http-api} booster] to log the `name` variable in the `/api/greeting` method:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get routes
...
$ curl $APPLICATION_ROUTE/api/greeting?name=Sarah
----

. Return to your pod logs and notice there are no debug logging messages in the logs. 

. Set the `DEBUG` environment variable to enable debug logging.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get dc
...
$ oc set env dc DC_NAME DEBUG=mybooster
----

. Return to your pod logs and start following the new pod.
+
After the update is rolled out, a new pod is started with your update and the current pod is stopped. This means you need to start following the new pod.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
# current pod stops
...
$ oc get pods
...
$ oc logs -f pod/POD_NAME
----
+
IMPORTANT: After your pod has started, keep watching the logs. This is where the debug logging will appear.

. Test the application to invoke debug logging. 
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get routes
...
$ curl $APPLICATION_ROUTE/api/greeting?name=Sarah
----

. View the application logs to see the debug messages.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
...
mybooster name: Sarah +3m
----


To disable debug logging, remove the `DEBUG` environment variable from the pod:
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc set env dc DC_NAME DEBUG-
----
