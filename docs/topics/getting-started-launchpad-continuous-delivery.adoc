To launch using continuous delivery, click the _Use OpenShift Online to build and deploy_ button. This will:

* Create a new GitHub repository in your namespace containing the mission's code
* Create a pipeline to continuously deliver your mission's code on each push to your repository's master branch
* The pipeline will then build and deploy the codebase on OpenShift Online

IMPORTANT: Before proceeding, make sure you have granted *launch.openshift.io* access to GitHub and OpenShift; this one-time step can be done https://sso.openshift.io/auth/realms/launchpad/account/identity[here, window="_blank"].
