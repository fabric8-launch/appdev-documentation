### Add a New Guide

. Create a new folder for the guide under `docs/` e.g. `docs/my-new-guide`.

. Under that folder:
** Create a `master.adoc` file.

** Create a symlink called `topics` to `../topics`.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
ln -s ../topics topics
----

** Copy the `buildGuide.sh` script from another guide's folder and modify line 3. This defines the output name of the html file. This should match the folder name.

. Add the default content to master.adoc.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
include::topics/templates/document-attributes.adoc[]

:my-new-guide:

= {my-new-guide-guide-name}
----

. Update `docs/topics/templates/document-attributes.adoc` by adding the guide name attribute.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
:my-new-guide-guide-name: My Awesome New guide
----

. Run the `scripts/buildGuides.sh` script to ensure the new guide builds with the others.

. Open the generated html file to ensure everything looks correct.

You have now created the scaffolding for a new guide. When you are ready for some initial review and feedback, file a pull request to `upstream/master`.
