= Building and Deploying the {name-mission-secured} Booster to the {OpenShiftContainerPlatform}

In addition to the {OpenShiftLocal}, you can build and deploy the booster on {OpenShiftContainerPlatform} with only minor differences. The most important difference is that you need to create the booster application on {OpenShiftLocal} before you can deploy it with {OpenShiftContainerPlatform}.
