. Get your authentication token for using the `oc` CLI client with your {OpenShiftLocal} account. You can find this in the {OpenShiftLocal} Web console. In the above example, your token would be located at `https://192.168.99.100:8443/console/command-line`.

. Authenticate your `oc` CLI client with your {OpenShiftLocal} account by using your authentication token.

$ oc get pods -w

A pod's route information gives you the base URL which you use to access it. In the example above, you would use `http://health-check-myproject.192.168.64.3.nip.io ` as the base URL to access the applications.
