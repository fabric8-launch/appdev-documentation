= Debug logging for a {Node} application

:parent-context: {context}

Debug logging is a way to add detailed information to the application log when debugging.
The use of debug logging provides several advantages:

* Keep minimal logging output during normal operation of the application for improved readability and reduced disk space usage.
* View detailed information about the inner workings of the application when resolving issues.
