[IMPORTANT]
====
You must still create a booster using the {launcher} tool before you can deploy it using the `oc` CLI client. 

If you choose _I will build and run locally_, unzip the ZIP file you downloaded. If you chose _Use {OpenShiftOnline} to build and deploy_ you need to clone the GitHub repository created by the {launcher} tool.
