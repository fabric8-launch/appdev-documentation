= Launcher health check capability

:parent-context: {context}

When you deploy an application, it is important to know if it is available and if it can start handling incoming requests. Implementing the _health check_ pattern allows you to monitor the health of an application, which includes if an application is available and whether it is able to service requests.

NOTE: If you are not familiar with the health check terminology, see the xref:health-check-concepts_{context}[] section first.
