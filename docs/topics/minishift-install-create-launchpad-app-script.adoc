= Using an Automated Script

You can install the {launcher} application to your {OpenShiftLocal} using link:{link-launcher-install-script}[an automated script]. The script will:

* Create a project in your {OpenShiftLocal}.
* Deploy the {launcher} application to that project using the link:{link-launcher-yaml}[latest template].
* Configure the {launcher} application with your GitHub username and personal access token.
* Update the Jenkins _serviceaccount_ to use the `admin` role.

To use the automated script: 

. link:{link-launcher-install-script}[Download] the script.
. Run the script.
** Run the script with username and password.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./deploy_launchpad_mission.sh -p PROJECT_NAME -i developer:developer -g GITHUB_USERNAME:GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
----

** Run the script with your {OpenShiftLocal} access token.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./deploy_launchpad_mission.sh -p PROJECT_NAME -i OPENSHIFT_TOKEN -g GITHUB_USERNAME:GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
----

** Run the script and specify the version of the {launcher} application template to use.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ./deploy_launchpad_mission.sh -p PROJECT_NAME -i developer:developer -g myGithubUser:myGithubToken -v v8

The grey circles reference that the docker images for these services are being pulled down from the network. This is a one time step that may take some time. Eventually the circles will turn a light blue to note that they are starting, then a deeper blue to indicate when they are running. 
+
When all services are running, you are ready to use the {launcher} application.  

. Click the link at the top of all services, which should end in `nip.io`.
+
A new browser tab will open with the {launcher} application.

You are now running on your local cloud the same service we will be hosting over at `launch.openshift.io`. See the link:{link-getting-started-guide}#boosters[{getting-started-guide-name}] for more details on using the {launcher} application to launch mission booster applications.
