= Configuring a Jenkins freestyle project to deploy your {Node} application with nodeshift

Similar to using nodeshift from your local host to deploy a {Node} application, you can configure Jenkins to use nodeshift to deploy a {Node} application.

.Prerequisites
* Access to an OpenShift cluster.
* link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/other_images/jenkins.html[The Jenkins container image] running on same OpenShift cluster.
* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/nodejs[The {Node} plugin] installed on your Jenkins server.
* A {Node} application configured to use link:https://github.com/nodeshift/nodeshift[nodeshift] and the Red Hat base image.
+
.Example using the Red Hat base image with nodeshift
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ nodeshift --dockerImage=registry.access.redhat.com/rhoar-nodejs/nodejs-8 ...
----
* The source of the application available in GitHub.

.Procedure
. Create a new OpenShift project for your application:
.. Open the OpenShift Web console and log in.
.. Click _Create Project_ to create a new OpenShift project.
.. Enter the project information and click _Create_.

. Ensure Jenkins has access to that project.
+
For example, if you configured a service account for Jenkins, ensure that account has `edit` access to the project of your application.

. Create a new link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Building+a+software+project#Buildingasoftwareproject-Settinguptheproject[freestyle Jenkins project] on your Jenkins server:
.. Click _New Item_.
.. Enter a name, choose _Freestyle project_, and click _OK_.
.. Under _Source Code Management_, choose _Git_ and add the GitHub url of your application.
.. Under _Build Environment_, make sure _Provide Node & npm bin/ folder to PATH_ is checked and the {Node} environment is configured.
.. Under _Build_, choose _Add build step_ and select `Execute Shell`.
.. Add the following to the _Command_ area:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
npm install -g nodeshift
nodeshift --strictSSL=false --dockerImage=registry.access.redhat.com/rhoar-nodejs/nodejs-8 --namespace=MY_PROJECT
----
+
Substitute `MY_PROJECT` with the name of the OpenShift project for your application.
.. Click _Save_.

. Click _Build Now_ from the main page of the Jenkins project to verify your application builds and deploys to the OpenShift project for your application.
+
You can also verify that your application is deployed by opening the route in the OpenShift project of the application.

== Next steps
* Consider adding link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Github+Plugin#GitHubPlugin-GitHubhooktriggerforGITScmpolling[GITSCM polling] or using link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Building+a+software+project#Buildingasoftwareproject-Buildsbysourcechanges[the `Poll SCM` build trigger]. These options enable builds to run every time a new commit is pushed to the GitHub repository.
* Consider adding nodeshift as a global package when link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/NodeJS+Plugin[configuring the {Node} plugin]. This allows you to omit `npm install -g nodeshift` when adding your `Execute Shell` build step.
* Consider adding a build step that executes tests before deploying.
