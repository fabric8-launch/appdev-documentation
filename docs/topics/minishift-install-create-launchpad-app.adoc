. Fill out the following fields. 
** Your GitHub username.
** Your personal access token for GitHub
** The OpenShift Console URL from Minishift. This should be the same base URL you are currently using to complete the form, for example `https://192.168.42.152:8443`.
** OpenShift username and password from Minishift. 
** KeyCloak URL and Realm should be cleared out
** Catalog Git Repository and `gitref` should be generally left as-is, unless you are developing against a specific fork you'd like to use.
** Catalog index period may be left to 0 unless you'd like the catalog to index at some interval in minutes.
** Launchpad Backend URL must be updated to replace `PROJECTNAME` with the name of your project. This example uses `launchpad`. You also need to confirm that the IP address in the string matches your Openshift Console URL.

WARNING: Before proceeding to the next steps, confirm all the fields are correct.

. Click `Create` to complete the setup. You will see a screen confirming that the application has been created, and it will invite you to go to the overview.  

. Proceed to the overview page and confirm that the three services for Launchpad are starting up.

The grey circles reference that the docker images for these services are being pulled down from the network. This is a one time step that may take some time.  Eventually the circles will turn a light blue to note that they are starting, then a deeper blue to indicate when they are running.  

. When all services are running, you are ready to use the Launchpad application.  Click the link at the top of all services, which should end in `nip.io`, and a new browser tab will open with the Launchpad.

You are now running on your local cloud the same service we will be hosting over at `launch.openshift.io`.
