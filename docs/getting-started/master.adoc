This guide covers basic information to get started using {ProductName} for cloud-native development on OpenShift.

It shows you how to create and deploy example cloud-native applications to OpenShift using {name-launcher-oso} or {name-launcher}.

These example applications can serve as the foundation for your actual cloud-native microservices because they can be updated and redeployed using the same deployment process detailed in this guide.
