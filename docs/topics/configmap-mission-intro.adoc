This mission shows you how to:

* Set up and configure a `ConfigMap`.
* Use the configuration provided by the `ConfigMap` within an application.
* Deploy changes to the `ConfigMap` configuration of running applications.

.About Externalized Configuration
It is important for the application configuration to be externalized and separated from its code. This allows the application configuration to change as it moves through different environments while leaving the code unchanged. This also keeps sensitive or internal information out of your code base and version control. Many languages and application servers provide environment variables to support externalizing an application's configuration.
Microservices architectures and polyglot environments add a layer of complexity to managing an application's configuration. Applications are comprised of independent, distributed services, each potentially with its own configuration.
This creates a maintenance challenge to keep the configuration synchronized and accessible from all services.
