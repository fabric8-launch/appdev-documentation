NOTE: We are working on removing this step entirely, but for now it is required. The full details and a current status are available link:https://github.com/openshiftio/launchpad-templates/issues/2[on GitHub].

. Click _Create_, ensure that only the _Process the template_ option is selected, and click _Continue_.

. Fill out the following fields. 
** _Your GitHub username_.
** _Your GitHub Mission Control access token_ is your personal access token for GitHub.
** The _Target OpenShift Console URL_ is the OpenShift Console URL from {OpenShiftLocal}. This should be the same base URL you are currently using to complete the form, for example `https://192.168.42.152:8443`.
** OpenShift username and password from {OpenShiftLocal}. 
** _KeyCloak URL_ and _KeyCloak Realm_ should be cleared out
** _Catalog Git Repository_ and _Catalog Git Reference_ should be generally left as-is, unless you are developing against a specific fork you would like to use.
** _Catalog Index Period_ may be left to `0` unless you would like the catalog to index at some interval in minutes.
** _Launchpad Frontend Host_ must be updated to replace `$PROJECTNAME` with the name of your project. This example uses `launchpad`. You also need to update `$HOSTNAMEORIP` in the string to the IP address of your OpenShift Console URL.

WARNING: Before proceeding to the next steps, confirm all the fields are correct.

. Click `Create` to complete the setup. You will see a screen confirming that the application has been created. Click _Continue to overview_.

. On the overview page, wait and confirm that the three services for Launchpad are starting up.

+
The grey circles reference that the docker images for these services are being pulled down from the network. This is a one time step that may take some time. Eventually the circles will turn a light blue to note that they are starting, then a deeper blue to indicate when they are running. 

. When all services are running, you are ready to use the Launchpad application.  Click the link at the top of all services, which should end in `nip.io`, and a new browser tab will open with the Launchpad.

You are now running on your local cloud the same service we will be hosting over at `launch.openshift.io`.
