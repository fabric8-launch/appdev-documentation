== Deploy Booster to your {OpenShiftLocal}

Package and deploy your {runtime-name} Booster:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd app
$ mvn fabric8:deploy -DSSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL=<SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL from above...> -Popenshift -DskipTests=true
----

IMPORTANT: Make sure you pass in the SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL you obtained during the <<SSO_AUTH_SERVER_URL>> step.

This process will generate the uber JAR file as well as the OpenShift resources and deploy them to the current project on your {OpenShiftLocal} server.
