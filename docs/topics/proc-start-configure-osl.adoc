= Starting and Configuring the {OpenShiftLocal} for the {launcher} Application

This chapter covers starting the {OpenShiftLocal} and configuring it to run the {launcher} Application.


NOTE: Starting your {OpenShiftLocal} may trigger a download of large virtual machines or Linux container images. This may take a while. Subsequent startups should be shorter as long as the virtual machines and Linux container images remained cached.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since a {OpenShiftLocal} is for development purposes, it uses HTTPS for the web console and only provides a self-signed certificate. You may need to allow your browser to bypass SSL security policies as it tries to protect you from using `HTTPS` without a certificate signed by a certificate authority. The below screenshot shows the warning message in the Chrome browser.

At this time, Safari on macOS does not work with a {OpenShiftLocal}. This a link:https://github.com/openshiftio/appdev-planning/issues/16[known issue]. Other browsers, such as Chrome, on macOS do work with a {OpenShiftLocal}.

. Start the {OpenShiftLocal} with the default virtual machine driver.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift start --memory=4096
...
OpenShift server started.

The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://192.168.42.152:8443
----
** Alternatively, you may specify a virtual machine driver other than the default using the `--vm-driver` flag.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift start --memory=4096 --vm-driver=virtualbox
----
+
Depending upon your system setup, you may need manually specify an alternative virtual machine driver. Virtual machine software, such as link:https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox], is installed separately.
+
NOTE: On macOS `xhyve` is the default virtual machine driver and it may be unreliable. If you experience issues, the `VirtualBox` is a reliable alternative.
+
NOTE: Depending on your operating system, virtual machine driver, and the number of boosters you run, you may need to increase the amount memory you give you to your {OpenShiftLocal}.

. Open the {OpenShiftLocal} Web console.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift console
----
** Alternatively, you may use the URL provided in the log information.

. Log in using `developer` for the username and any value for the password.

. Optionally, you may delete the preconfigured project.
.. Next to the project name, click the three-dot menu icon.
.. Select _Delete Project_.
