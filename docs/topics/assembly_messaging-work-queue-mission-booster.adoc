This booster shows you how to:

* Send work requests to a work queue shared by multiple worker processes.
* Use the broker to receive and process incoming work requests.
* Send the processed result back to the original process.
* Scale the number of workers according to the current requirements of your application.
* Monitor the status of the worker processes.
