= Continuous Delivery using {OpenShiftLocal}

In addition to building on your local machine and pushing to a local or public cloud, you also have the ability to set up continuous delivery for a booster. Specifically you can use the {launcher} application to clone a new booster repository to your GitHub account and have it deployed to your {OpenShiftLocal}. 

. link:{link-launcher-openshift-local-install-guide}#create-launcher-app[Install the {launcher}] application to your {OpenShiftLocal}.
. Navigate to the {launcher} application on your {OpenShiftLocal} using your browser. 
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use the following command to open the Web Console of your {OpenShiftLocal} in your browser in order to navigate to your {launcher} application:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift console
----
====
. Select _Prepare for Takeoff_.
. Choose _Use {OpenShiftOnline} to build and deploy_.
. Choose `REST API Level 0` and click _Next_.
. Choose the {WildFlySwarm} runtime.
. Enter an _OpenShift Project name_. You can also update any of the additional metadata fields or leave them as the default. Click _Next_.
. Click the _Launch on OpenShift_ button.
+
This will:
+
** Create a new GitHub repository associated with your account containing the booster's code.
** Create a pipeline to continuously deliver your booster's code.
** The pipeline will then build and deploy your booster's code to your {OpenShiftLocal}.

. Click on the _See it here!_ link under _Creating your project on the OpenShift cloud_ to go to your booster's page in the OpenShift Web console.

To view the status of your project:

. Click _View Log_ in the pipeline at the top.
+
NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the link to appear.

. Click _Login with OpenShift_ at the login prompt for Jenkins. 
. Log in with your {OpenShiftLocal} credentials, for example `developer` for the username and password.
. Ensure all the boxes are checked and click _Allow selected permissions_.
+
This grants the OpenShift Web console the correct permissions and directs you to the Jenkins pod that is deploying your application.


Once your deployment is complete, interact with your booster using the URL for the booster application at the top of the page:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl wfswarm-rest-http-my-osl-demo.192.168.64.2.nip.io/api/greeting/
{"content":"Hello, World!"}
$ curl wfswarm-rest-http-my-osl-demo.192.168.64.2.nip.io/api/greeting?name=Sarah
{"content":"Hello, Sarah!"}
----

IMPORTANT: Your booster application is not the same as your Jenkins pod, and it will only appear after the Jenkins pod deploys it. This may take a few minutes.

At this point, you have created a new booster repository in your GitHub account and deployed it to {OpenShiftLocal}. To push changes to this booster in {OpenShiftLocal}, you can push a new commit to the GitHub repository and start a build pipeline.


. Clone your project from GitHub.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/PROJECT-NAME.git
----

. Open your project in your desired IDE or editor, such as xref:use_jbds[JBDS].
. Update `src/main/java/io/openshift/booster/GreetingEndpoint.java` to present a different greeting. 
+
.Example update to `GreetingEndpoint.java`
[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
@Path("/")
public class GreetingEndpoint {
  
  private static final String template = "Greetings, %s!";
  ...
}
----

. Save your changes.
. Commit and push your changes back to GitHub.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Made an update"
$ git push
----

. Navigate back to the {OpenShiftLocal} Web console and ensure your mission's project is selected.
. Click on _Builds_ then _Pipelines_.
. Click _Start Pipeline_ to start a new build with your updates.
+
A new build will appear in the _Recent Runs_ list and the status of the `Build` and `Deploy` stages will appear. Optionally, you can click _View Log_ in your build to see the logs in Jenkins.

. After the `Deploy` stage is complete, return to the deployed version of your mission's booster application and observe that your changes appear.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl wfswarm-rest-http-my-osl-demo.192.168.64.2.nip.io/api/greeting/
{"content":"Greetings, World!"}
$ curl wfswarm-rest-http-my-osl-demo.192.168.64.2.nip.io/api/greeting?name=Sarah
{"content":"Greetings, Sarah!"}
----

NOTE: If you would like changes in your booster committed to GitHub to be automatically pushed to your {OpenShiftLocal}, you can xref:ultrahook-setup[configure UltraHook]
