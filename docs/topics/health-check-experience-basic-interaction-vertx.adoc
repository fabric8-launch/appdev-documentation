= Interact with the Unmodified {VertX} Booster

Once you have the {VertX} booster deployed, you will have two applications running: `hello-service` and `name-service`. The `name-service` exposes a REST endpoint which returns a name as a String. The `hello-service` exposes a REST endpoint that returns a hello message as a String. When you call the REST endpoint in `hello-service`, the `hello-service` application makes a call to `name-service` to obtain a name String to use in the hello message String. 

. Use `curl` to execute a `GET` request against the `hello-service`. You can also use a browser to do this.

$ curl http://hello-service.192.168.99.100.nip.io/greeting
Hello World!
----

. Scale down the number of `name-service` pods, which are used by `hello-service`, to 0.

$ oc get pods
NAME                        READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
hello-service-1-aaaaa       1/1       Running     0          6m
hello-service-s2i-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          6m
name-service-1-bbbbb        1/1       Running     0          6m
name-service-s2i-1-build    0/1       Completed   0          6m

$ oc scale pod name-service-1-bbbbb --replicas=0 
----

. Use `curl` to execute a `GET` request against the `hello-service` again. This should return an error since `name-service`, which is used by `hello-service` is unavailable and has failed . You can also use a browser to do this.

$ curl http://hello-service.192.168.99.100.nip.io/greeting
<html><body><h1>503 Service Unavailable</h1>
No server is available to handle this request.

----

. Scale up the number of `name-service` pods to 1.

$ oc scale pod name-service-1-bbbbb --replicas=1

. Ensure that the `name-service` pods are running again.

. Use `curl` to execute a `GET` request against the `hello-service` again. It should now succeed. You can also use a browser to do this.
